# Grid View Implementation for CollectionPage

## Overview
I've successfully implemented grid view functionality for the CollectionPage with separate mode persistence for each tab, similar to the CollectionsPage implementation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Grid Mode Toggle Button
- Added a grid/list toggle button in the AppBar actions
- Button icon changes based on current tab's grid mode state
- Shows Icons.grid_view when in list mode and Icons.view_list when in grid mode
- Includes proper tooltips for accessibility

### 2. Separate Grid Mode Per Tab
- **Regular Tasks Tab**: Has its own grid mode setting (`collection_regular_grid_mode`)
- **Recurrent Tasks Tab**: Has its own grid mode setting (`collection_recurrent_grid_mode`)
- Both settings are persisted using SharedPreferences
- Grid mode state is maintained separately for each tab

### 3. Regular Tasks Grid View
- Displays tasks in a 4-column grid layout
- One-tap completion toggle functionality (tap anywhere on task card)
- Visual feedback: completed tasks show green background and checkmark
- Similar styling to CollectionsPage grid view
- Proper empty state handling with informative messages

### 4. Recurrent Tasks Grid View
- Displays recurrent tasks in a 4-column grid layout
- Shows task names with refresh icon to indicate recurring nature
- Tap navigation to task details (no completion toggle since recurrent tasks don't complete)
- Consistent styling with other grid views
- Proper empty state handling

### 5. State Persistence
- Grid mode preferences are automatically saved and restored
- Each tab remembers its grid/list mode setting independently
- Settings persist across app restarts

## Technical Implementation

### Grid Mode State Management
```dart
// Grid mode settings for each tab
bool _regularTasksGridMode = false;
bool _recurrentTasksGridMode = false;
static const String _regularGridModeKey = 'collection_regular_grid_mode';
static const String _recurrentGridModeKey = 'collection_recurrent_grid_mode';
```

### Tab-Aware Toggle Logic
```dart
Future<void> _toggleCurrentTabGridMode() async {
  if (_tabController.index == 0) {
    await _toggleRegularTasksGridMode();
  } else {
    await _toggleRecurrentTasksGridMode();
  }
}
```

### Dynamic View Rendering
The `_buildBody()` method now conditionally renders grid or list view based on the current tab's grid mode setting.

## User Experience
- Seamless switching between grid and list modes
- Each tab maintains its own view preference
- Grid mode allows quick task completion with single taps
- Consistent visual design with existing grid implementations
- Proper loading states and empty state messaging

## Testing Notes
- No compilation errors detected
- Implementation follows existing UI consistency standards
- Compatible with existing swipe gestures in list mode
- Maintains all existing functionality while adding new grid features

The implementation is now ready for testing. Users can:
1. Navigate to any collection page
2. Toggle between tabs and switch to grid mode for each tab independently
3. Complete regular tasks with single taps in grid mode
4. Navigate to recurrent task details by tapping grid items
5. Settings persist across app sessions
