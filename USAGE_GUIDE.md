# 🚀 Task Sharing - User Guide

## How It Works Now ✅

### ✅ **Sharing Tasks**
1. Open any task in the app
2. Click the share button (📤) in the top bar
3. Choose how to share (email, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.)
4. A `.tasks` file is automatically created and shared

### ✅ **Receiving Tasks**
1. Someone shares a `.tasks` file with you
2. **Simply click on the file** (in email, messenger, etc.)
3. **The app opens automatically!** 🎉
4. Import page appears with all task data pre-filled
5. Choose a collection and save

## What Changed ✨

### ❌ **Removed (No Longer Needed)**
- Manual import buttons
- Copy/paste JSON dialogs
- File picker interfaces
- Complex import menus

### ✅ **Added (New Magic)**
- **File Association**: `.tasks` files open automatically in the app
- **Seamless Workflow**: Click file → App opens → Ready to import
- **Professional Experience**: Like opening PDF in PDF reader

## Example Workflow 📱

```
User A: TaskPage → Share → Send via WhatsApp
User B: Receives file → Clicks file → App opens → Import page → Save
```

## File Format 📄
- **Extension**: `.tasks` (not .json anymore)
- **Content**: Same JSON format, different extension
- **Example**: `task_123_20250127_143022.tasks`

## Benefits 🎯
- ✅ **Zero Manual Steps**: No copying, pasting, or file selection
- ✅ **Professional**: Works like any other file type
- ✅ **Reliable**: No plugin dependencies or compatibility issues
- ✅ **Clean UI**: Simplified interface, focus on core features

## Current Status: ✅ READY TO USE

The new file association system is production-ready and provides a much better user experience than manual import methods.
