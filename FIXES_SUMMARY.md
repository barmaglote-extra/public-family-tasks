# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Keystore File Not Found**: The main error was "Keystore file '/usr/local/lib/android/sdk/debug.keystore' not found for signing config 'release'"
2. **Outdated Tool Versions**: Warnings about outdated Gradle (8.4.0), Android Gradle Plugin (8.3.0), and Kotlin (1.9.20) versions
3. **Missing Fallback Mechanism**: No proper fallback when keystore secrets are not provided

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/build-apk.yml)

- Added proper keystore handling with conditional steps based on secret availability
- Added debugging information to verify keystore and properties files
- Added automatic debug keystore generation if it doesn't exist
- Added the `--android-skip-build-dependency-validation` flag to bypass version warnings
- Improved error handling and logging

### 2. Updated Gradle Configuration

- **gradle-wrapper.properties**: Updated Gradle version from 8.4 to 8.7
- **settings.gradle**: Updated Android Gradle Plugin from 8.3.0 to 8.6.0 and Kotlin from 1.9.20 to 2.1.0
- **app/build.gradle**: 
  - Enhanced signing configuration with better fallback handling
  - Added automatic debug keystore generation task
  - Improved build variant configuration

### 3. Enhanced Signing Configuration

- Created proper directory structure for keystore files
- Improved path handling for keystore files
- Added fallback to debug signing when release keystore is not available
- Added automatic debug keystore generation in the workflow

## How It Works Now

1. If keystore secrets are provided, the workflow will use them to sign the APK
2. If no keystore secrets are provided, it will automatically generate a debug keystore and use that for signing
3. The workflow now properly handles all the version warnings by using updated tool versions and appropriate flags
4. Enhanced logging helps diagnose any future issues

## Testing

After these changes, the workflow should successfully build the APK without the keystore error. The APK will be signed either with the provided release keystore or with a debug keystore if no release keystore is available.
