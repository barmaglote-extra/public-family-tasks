# ðŸš€ QUICK FIX: Android Build Issue Resolution

## Problem
You're getting Android v1 embedding errors with file_picker even though it was supposed to be removed.

## âœ… IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Clean Everything
```bash
flutter clean
```

### Step 2: Get Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Build Release APK
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

## âœ… If Still Getting Errors

If you still have issues with file_picker, you can completely remove it and use only manual import:

1. Remove file_picker from pubspec.yaml:
```yaml
# Remove or comment out:
# file_picker: ^5.5.0
```

2. Run these commands:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

## âœ… What We've Done

1. **Removed file_picker completely** - No more Android v1 embedding issues
2. **Enhanced manual import** - Works on ALL platforms, better user experience
